## JsRender: Next-generation jQuery Templates
_Optimized for high-performance pure string-based rendering, without DOM or jQuery dependency._<br/>
To view demo pages (on gh-branch) navigate to [http://borismoore.github.com/jsrender/demos/index.html](http://borismoore.github.com/jsrender/demos/index.html "JsRender Samples").<br/>

JsRender is used for rendering of templates to strings, ready for insertion in the DOM.<br/>
It can also be used together with [JsViews](https://github.com/BorisMoore/jsviews), which then provides interactive data-driven views. See [JsViews step-by-step samples](http://borismoore.github.com/jsviews/demos/index.html).<br/>

See [Approaching Beta: What's changing in JsRender and JsViews](http://www.borismoore.com/2012/03/approaching-beta-whats-changing-in_06.html) for documentation of changes.<br/>

**Warning:** JsRender is not yet officially beta, though the APIs and code are now stable. JsViews, on the other hand, is still evolving (with a number of
powerful features arriving), and its Beta is currently planned for late September or early October. Since this could lead to small API changes in JsRender
(to accomodate JsViews integration) JsRender will not be declared officially Beta until around the same time. Thank you for you patience!<br/>
