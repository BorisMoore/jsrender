JsRender integrates with [JsViews](https://github.com/BorisMoore/jsviews), to provide interactive data-driven views. See [JsViews step-by-step samples](http://borismoore.github.com/jsviews/demos/index.html).<br/>

See [Approaching Beta: What's changing in JsRender and JsViews](http://www.borismoore.com/2012/03/approaching-beta-whats-changing-in_06.html) for documentation of changes.<br/>
